        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>5 tbsp garam masala or allspice</li>
                <li>2 tbsp turmeric</li>
                <li>2 tbsp black pepper</li>
                <li>2 tbsp cinnamon</li>
                <li>1 tbsp paprika</li>
                <li>1 tbsp coriander</li>
                <li>1 tbsp cumin</li>
                <li>1 tbsp cayenne pepper</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Soak the bulgur wheat in enough water to cover and set aside.</li>
                <li>To make the filling, saut√© the chopped onions in regular olive oil until golden on medium low heat.</li>
                <li>Add 500g of minced meat to the onions and cook out the meat on medium high heat.</li>
                <li>Add the 7 spice, kamouneh spices, black pepper and salt and use the back of your wooden spoon to break up the meat.</li>
                <li>When it is cooked turn off the heat and add the sumac and chopped walnuts. Taste to make any adjustments then cover and set aside.</li>
                <li>Drain the bulgur wheat and add to a large bowl. Take out the kilo of meat and prepare food processor.</li>
                <li>In several batches, add the bulgur wheat and equal amounts of meat to the food processor and process until it clumps together and starts to roll in the processor bowl.</li>
                <li>Roughly chop 2 onions to go in the food processor along with the 7 spices, kamouneh spices, black pepper and salt (Blitz well).</li>
                <li>When you have combined all the meat and bulgur wheat in a bowl, add the blitzed onion spice mix and the cornflour, then bring everything together preferably with your hands.</li>
                <li>If it is too dry add a bit of water, you don't want it too loose, sticky or crumbly but so it holds together nicely. If you don't mind tasting a bit of raw meat check a tiny bit for saltiness and adjust as necessary.</li>
                <li>Add approx half a cup of sunflower to a small bowl which you can dip your fingers into when shaping the kibbeh to avoid sticking. Clean your table and arrange a workflow with a large clean tray, the sunflower oil, the filling and the casing mix.</li>
                <li>Take some casing and roll into golf ball size, indent the middle then hollow out the inside with your index finger turning as you do so until you have a half shell. Add a spoon of filling and close up the casing. Compress well with your hands and shape into classic kibbeh morsels.</li>
                <li>Line up the kibbeh on the tray until you finish the filling.</li>
                <li>Deep fry your kibbeh morsels in sunflower or vegetable oil and serve with yoghurt dip.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To shape kibbeh first make an indent in a golf sized ball as you turn the kibbeh. Then once you have a hollow shell, add some filling and close it up by pinching and turning in your hands until smooth.</li>
                <li>For the meat, use a ratio of 50:50 lamb to beef but you can also do 70:30 depending on which you prefer.</li>
                <li>You can add extra lean lamb fat for a more rich taste.</li>
            </ul>
